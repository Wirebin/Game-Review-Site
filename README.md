# Game-Review-Site
A site where you can review games and have discussions with other people about them.
The site allows you to make an account and give scores to different games. Reviews and discussion posts require an account.
There are 2 access levels, one for standard users and another for an admin. An admin can add new games to the database and 
remove/edit reviews and discussion posts if needed.
